# Aurora IDE

Planned (short-mid term):
- ~~Rename~~, create, delete files on the tree view
- ~~Settings~~
- Themes (+built-in dark mode theme and anime theme)
- ~~Markdown preview~~
- ~~Integrated webview: little browser (search bar, reload, arrows, start w/ google.com) and automatic, button-less HTML view. Use firefox if possible, or Chromium if not possible. (*I'd love to include gecko but mozilla doesn't seem to want to do this*)~~
- Integrated terminal
- Web-based terminal and code editor (codemirror and xtermjs)
- Translations to other languages
- Eventually move to a static language such as C++ and reconsider GTK
- Extension API with decentralized plugin system: no backend, only git.
- Auto updates
